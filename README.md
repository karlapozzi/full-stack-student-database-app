# A Full Stack App Project
My tenth Treehouse project: A full stack student database app made with React and the REST API I built in my unit 9 project (using Express, Sequelize, and Node.js). This app creates a client for the existing API so that school admins can interact with the API and database. 

Additionally, this project requires user to create an account and sign in to make changes. I'm also going for an exceeds expectation grade, so my project includes the extra credit steps for displaying user friendly error message, persisting user credentials, and redirecting users to their previous screen after they sign.
