# A Full Stack App Project
My tenth Treehouse project: A full stack student database app made with React and the REST API I built using Express in my previous project. This app creates a client for the existing API so that "school admins" can interact with the API and database. Users are required to create an account and sign in to make changes. 

I'm going for an exceeds expectation grade, so my project also includes the extra credit steps for displaying user friendly error message, persisting user credentials, and redirecting users to their previous screen after they sign.
